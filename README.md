# Simple SVG Editor
###### Made as a project for the Object Oriented Programming course @ FMI, Sofia University.

### Description

Simple SVG Editor is a simple console application that allows the user to create and edit SVG files, providing a simple set of commands to do so. 

A good level of abstraction is achieved by using a set of classes to represent the SVG shape and the shape object behavior.

Full description of the project can be found in the [ProjectDescription.pdf](./ProjectDescription.pdf) file - the course assignment.
